# Malware Detection using Machine Learning

### Research Paper Published: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9456440

We have developed a sophisticated desktop application designed to enhance cybersecurity by effectively identifying and mitigating malicious files residing on Windows-based systems. Additionally, we have implemented a web extension that empowers users to assess the security of web URLs, determining their potential maliciousness. Our approach involves the utilization of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to bolster these functionalities:

**Malware Detection on Desktop Application:**
- For the core malware detection feature within our desktop application, we harnessed the power of Random Forest, an ensemble learning method known for its robustness and accuracy.
- Our model has been meticulously trained on a rich dataset, primarily focusing on PE (Portable Executable) files' header values, which are integral components for determining the nature of files and identifying malicious attributes.
- The training process involved the extraction of vital features and the utilization of expert knowledge to curate a diverse and representative dataset.
- Rigorous testing and validation were conducted to ensure the model's reliability and effectiveness in detecting various forms of malware, safeguarding Windows-based systems from potential threats.

**Web Extension for URL Security Assessment:**
- In tandem with the desktop application, our web extension serves as a valuable tool for assessing the safety of web URLs, providing users with real-time insights into potential security risks.
- The model underpinning the web extension is a Logistic Regression model, carefully trained on patterns extracted from known malicious web URLs.
- This model leverages its learning to classify URLs based on their characteristics, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding the safety of web links they encounter.

By combining the power of Random Forest for file-based malware detection and Logistic Regression for web URL security assessment, our integrated desktop application and web extension offer comprehensive protection, bolstering the cybersecurity posture of Windows users. These tools exemplify our commitment to enhancing digital security and safeguarding against evolving threats in an ever-changing cyber landscape.
